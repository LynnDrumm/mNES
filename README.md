# mNES
NES emulator in mIRCscript


this is a learning experience for me. Figuring things out as I go. I don't know what I'm doing, please keep that in mind if you read the source.

only a small handful of opcodes are (probably poorly) emulated so far, don't expect anything to run (yet).

don't judge me too harshly ðŸ¥ºðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ
